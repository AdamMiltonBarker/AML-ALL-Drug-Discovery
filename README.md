# Acute Myeloid Leukemia
[Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)](https://www.leukemiaairesearch.com/research/leukemia), is a blood cancer caused by uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal myeloid precursor cells. It accounts for approximately 90% of all acute leukemias in adults. The incidence of AML increases with age. Most patients with AML are aged 65 years and over. Only 6% of patients, more or less, are younger than 20 years. AML prognosis is very poor, with a 5-year survival of < 10% in patients older than 60 years at diagnosis. The prognosis is better in younger patients.

# Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
[Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)](https://www.leukemiaairesearch.com/research/leukemia), also known as Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia, is a cancer that affects the lymphoid blood cell lineage. It is the most common leukemia in children, and it accounts for 10-20% of acute leukemias in adults. The prognosis for both adult and especially childhood ALL has improved substantially since the 1970s. The 5- year survival is approximately 95% in children. In adults, the 5-year survival varies between 25% and 75%, with more favorable results in younger than in older patients.
